I am a graduate student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad pursuing my masterâ€™s degree with research at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT). My thesis work is centered around understanding the generalization of neural networks. I also work in collaboration with Tata Research Development and Design Center (TRDDC), Pune, where I have worked as a full time researcher earlier. My work at TRDDC is at the intersection of Multimedia, AI, and Behavioural Science. Before joining TRDDC, I worked at TCS research for over a year as a researcher and learning enabler at ILP Innovation Labs, Trivandrum. I completed my B.Tech. in 'Electronics and Communication Engineering' from Amrita School of Engineering (ASE), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
